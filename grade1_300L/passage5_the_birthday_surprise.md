Today is Mom's birthday. Jake wants to do something special for her. He has a secret plan.

Early in the morning, Jake wakes up quietly. He goes to the kitchen. His big sister Anna is already there.

"Are you ready to make breakfast for Mom?" asks Anna.

"Yes!" whispers Jake with a big smile.

Anna helps Jake make pancakes. Jake cracks the eggs very carefully. Anna mixes the batter. Jake pours the pancakes on the pan. They look perfect!

Next, Jake picks flowers from the garden. He puts them in a pretty vase. Anna sets the table with Mom's favorite dishes.

"Everything looks beautiful," says Anna. "Let's wake up Mom!"

They bring the breakfast tray to Mom's bedroom. Mom opens her eyes and sees the surprise.

"Happy birthday, Mom!" they shout together.

Mom smiles so big. "This is the best birthday surprise ever!" she says. She gives Jake and Anna huge hugs.

Jake feels proud. He made Mom's birthday special!
