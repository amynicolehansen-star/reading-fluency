Plants need four things to grow. They need water, air, sunlight, and soil.

First, you plant a seed in the soil. The soil gives the plant food. You water the seed. Water helps the seed grow.

The seed begins to change. A tiny root grows down into the soil. Then a small stem pushes up through the dirt.

Soon, you see a green shoot. This is the baby plant. It needs sunlight. The sun helps the plant make food.

The plant grows bigger and bigger. It grows leaves. Some plants grow flowers. Some plants grow fruits or vegetables.

Plants give us many things. We eat fruits and vegetables. We use wood from trees. Plants also make the air clean.

Take care of plants. They are important!
