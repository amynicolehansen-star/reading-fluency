Butterflies go through an amazing transformation during their lives. This     10
process is called metamorphosis, and it has four distinct stages that can     22
take anywhere from a few weeks to several months.                             31
    The first stage begins when a female butterfly lays tiny eggs on a leaf.  46
She carefully chooses plants that will provide food for her babies. Each      58
egg is smaller than a pinhead, but it contains everything needed to start a   72
new life.                                                                      74
    In the second stage, a caterpillar hatches from the egg. The              85
caterpillar's main job is to eat. It munches on leaves constantly, growing    97
bigger and bigger. As it grows, the caterpillar sheds its skin several times 110
because the old skin becomes too tight.                                      117
    The third stage is perhaps the most mysterious. The caterpillar forms a  130
hard shell called a chrysalis around its body. Inside this protective        142
covering, the caterpillar's body completely reorganizes itself. Wings, legs, 151
and antennae develop during this resting period.                             158
    Finally, in the fourth stage, an adult butterfly emerges from the        170
chrysalis. At first, its wings are wet and crumpled. The butterfly must pump 183
fluid into its wings and wait for them to dry before it can fly away and     199
begin the cycle again.                                                       203

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. What are the four stages of a butterfly's life cycle?

2. Why does a caterpillar shed its skin several times?

3. What happens inside the chrysalis during the third stage?

4. Why can't a butterfly fly immediately after emerging from the chrysalis?
