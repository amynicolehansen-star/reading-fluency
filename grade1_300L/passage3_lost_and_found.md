Emma has a favorite stuffed rabbit named Fluffy. She takes Fluffy everywhere. One day, Emma goes to the park with her family.

Emma plays on the swings. She goes down the slide. She runs around the playground. She has so much fun!

When it is time to go home, Emma looks for Fluffy. But Fluffy is not there!

"Mom! I cannot find Fluffy!" cries Emma. She feels very sad.

Mom helps Emma look everywhere. They check the swings. They look by the slide. They search near the trees. But they do not find Fluffy.

"Let's check the lost and found," says Mom.

They walk to the park office. A kind woman sits behind the desk.

"Did you lose something?" asks the woman.

"Yes, my rabbit," says Emma quietly.

The woman smiles and holds up Fluffy! "Is this your rabbit?" she asks.

"Fluffy!" shouts Emma happily. She hugs her rabbit tight.

Emma is so glad to have Fluffy back!
