We use our senses to learn about the world. We have five senses.

We use our eyes to see. Eyes help us see colors and shapes. We can see people, animals, and things around us.

We use our ears to hear. Ears help us hear sounds. We can hear music, voices, and noises.

We use our nose to smell. Our nose helps us smell good things like flowers and cookies. It also warns us about bad smells.

We use our tongue to taste. Our tongue has taste buds. We can taste sweet, salty, sour, and bitter foods.

We use our skin to touch and feel. Our skin tells us if something is hot or cold. It tells us if something is soft or hard.

Our five senses work together. They help us every day!
