Earth has four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasons change  12
because Earth tilts as it travels around the sun. Different parts of Earth    25
get more or less sunlight at different times of the year.                     36

Spring is a time of new growth. The weather gets warmer after the cold        50
winter. Flowers begin to bloom, and trees grow new leaves. Baby animals are   63
born. Many birds return from their winter homes in warmer places. People      75
plant gardens and enjoy the mild weather.                                      82

Summer is the warmest season. The days are long, and the sun is strong.       96
Trees are full of green leaves. Many fruits and vegetables ripen in summer.  109
Children have vacation from school. Families go to the beach, have picnics,  121
and play outside.                                                              124

Fall, also called autumn, comes after summer. The weather starts to get       136
cooler. Leaves on many trees change color from green to red, orange, yellow,  149
and brown. Then the leaves fall to the ground. Animals gather food to         162
prepare for winter. Farmers harvest their crops.                              169

Winter is the coldest season. The days are short, and the nights are long. In 184
many places, snow falls and covers the ground. Some animals hibernate, which  196
means they sleep through the winter. Other animals grow thick fur to stay     209
warm. People wear heavy coats, hats, and gloves when they go outside.         221
