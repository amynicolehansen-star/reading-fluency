Tommy and his dad pack the car for their camping trip. They bring a tent, sleeping bags, food, and fishing poles. Tommy is very excited because this is his first time camping.

They drive to the mountains and find a perfect spot next to a lake. Dad shows Tommy how to set up the tent. Together, they hammer the stakes into the ground and pull the tent tight.

"Good teamwork!" says Dad with a smile.

After the tent is ready, they go fishing at the lake. Tommy holds his fishing pole very still. Suddenly, he feels a tug!

"Dad! I got one!" shouts Tommy.

Dad helps Tommy reel in the fish. It is a beautiful trout with shiny scales. They take a picture with the fish before putting it back in the water.

That evening, they cook hot dogs over the campfire. Tommy roasts marshmallows for dessert. The marshmallows turn golden brown and taste delicious.

When the sky gets dark, Dad and Tommy lie on a blanket and look up at the stars. Tommy has never seen so many stars before! They look for constellations in the night sky.

"This is the best day ever," says Tommy sleepily.

"I'm glad you're having fun," says Dad, giving Tommy a hug.
