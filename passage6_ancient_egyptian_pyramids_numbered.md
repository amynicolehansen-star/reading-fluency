The pyramids of ancient Egypt are among the most recognizable structures      11
in the world. Built thousands of years ago, these massive stone monuments     23
continue to amaze people today. The largest and most famous is the Great      36
Pyramid of Giza, which was constructed around 2560 BCE as a tomb for          49
Pharaoh Khufu.                                                                 51
    Building the pyramids required incredible planning and effort. Workers    60
had to cut enormous limestone blocks from quarries, with each block           71
weighing about two and a half tons—as much as a large elephant. Then they     86
transported these heavy stones to the building site, sometimes from miles     97
away. Historians believe that workers used wooden sleds and rollers to move  109
the blocks, and may have wet the sand in front of the sleds to reduce       124
friction.                                                                     125
    Once the stones arrived at the pyramid site, workers faced another       136
challenge: lifting them into place. The Great Pyramid stands 481 feet tall   148
and contains approximately 2.3 million stone blocks. Researchers think the   158
ancient Egyptians built long ramps that spiraled around the pyramid,         168
allowing workers to drag the blocks up to higher levels as the structure     181
grew.                                                                         182
    The pyramids weren't just impressive feats of construction. They also    192
demonstrate the ancient Egyptians' advanced understanding of mathematics     200
and astronomy. The sides of the Great Pyramid are almost perfectly aligned   212
with the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. This level  225
of precision, achieved without modern tools, shows the remarkable skills of  236
these ancient builders.                                                       239
