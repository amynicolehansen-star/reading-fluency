Firefighters are community helpers. They have an important job. They keep    10
people safe from fires.                                                       14

Firefighters wear special clothes to stay safe. They wear thick coats and    26
pants. These protect them from heat and flames. They also wear heavy boots   39
and helmets on their heads.                                                   44

Firefighters ride in big red trucks called fire engines. The trucks carry    56
water hoses, ladders, and other tools. When firefighters hear an alarm, they 68
slide down a pole and jump on the truck. The truck races to the fire with    84
its sirens on.                                                                87

At the fire, firefighters work as a team. Some spray water on the flames.    101
Others help people get out of burning buildings. Some firefighters use       112
ladders to reach high places.                                                117

Firefighters also teach people about fire safety. They visit schools to show 129
children how to stay safe. They tell us to have smoke alarms in our homes.   145

Firefighters are brave helpers. They risk their lives to save others!        156
