Plants need four things to grow. They need water, air, sunlight, and soil.    13

First, you plant a seed in the soil. The soil gives the plant food. You       28
water the seed. Water helps the seed grow.                                     36

The seed begins to change. A tiny root grows down into the soil. Then a       51
small stem pushes up through the dirt.                                         58

Soon, you see a green shoot. This is the baby plant. It needs sunlight. The   73
sun helps the plant make food.                                                 79

The plant grows bigger and bigger. It grows leaves. Some plants grow          91
flowers. Some plants grow fruits or vegetables.                                98

Plants give us many things. We eat fruits and vegetables. We use wood from   112
trees. Plants also make the air clean.                                        119

Take care of plants. They are important!                                      126
