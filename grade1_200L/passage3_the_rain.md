Lily looks out the window. She sees dark clouds in the sky.

"It is going to rain," says Mom.

Soon, raindrops start to fall. They make a tap-tap sound on the roof. Lily likes the sound.

The rain gets harder. Water runs down the street. Lily sees a big puddle in the yard.

"Can I go outside?" asks Lily.

"Yes, but put on your boots," says Mom.

Lily puts on her red rain boots. She runs outside. Splash! She jumps in the puddle. Water goes everywhere!

Lily laughs and laughs. Playing in the rain is so much fun.

After a while, the rain stops. The sun comes out. Lily sees a rainbow in the sky. It has many colors.

"Look, Mom! A rainbow!" calls Lily.
