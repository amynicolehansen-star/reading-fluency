Penguins are birds that cannot fly. They live in cold places near the ocean.  15
Most penguins live in Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth.                 25

Penguins have special bodies that help them survive in the cold. They have    39
thick feathers that keep them warm. Under their skin, they have a layer of    53
fat called blubber. This also helps keep them warm.                           62

Penguins are excellent swimmers. They use their wings like flippers to swim   74
through the water. They can swim very fast! Penguins hunt for fish, squid,    87
and small sea animals called krill.                                            93

On land, penguins walk in a funny way. They waddle from side to side.        107
Sometimes they slide on their bellies across the ice. This is called         119
tobogganing!                                                                   120

Penguin parents take care of their babies together. The mother lays an egg.  133
The father keeps the egg warm on his feet. When the baby penguin hatches,    148
both parents feed it and protect it.                                          155

Penguins live in large groups called colonies. Some colonies have thousands  166
of penguins!                                                                   168
