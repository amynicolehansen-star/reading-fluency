It is the last game of the season. Mia's soccer team, the Blue Tigers, is playing against the Red Dragons. The score is tied two to two. There are only five minutes left in the game.

Mia plays defense. Her job is to stop the other team from scoring goals. She runs up and down the field, watching the ball carefully.

Suddenly, a player from the Red Dragons kicks the ball hard toward Mia's goal. The ball flies through the air. Mia's teammate, the goalie, jumps up to catch it. But the ball bounces off his hands!

Mia sees the ball rolling toward the goal. She runs as fast as she can. Just before the ball crosses the line, Mia kicks it away. She saved the goal!

"Great save, Mia!" shouts her coach from the sideline.

Now the Blue Tigers have the ball. Mia kicks it to her teammate Lucas. Lucas dribbles down the field. He passes the ball to another teammate named Zoe. Zoe takes a shot at the goal.

The ball sails into the net! The Blue Tigers win the game three to two!

The team runs to Zoe and cheers. The coach gives everyone high fives. Mia feels proud of her team. They worked together and never gave up.
