Emma's hands trembled as she sat backstage, waiting for her turn to perform. She had practiced her piano piece hundreds of times, but now, with a room full of people waiting to hear her play, she felt her confidence melting away like ice cream on a hot day.

"Emma Chen," the announcer called. Her heart pounded as she walked onto the stage. The bright lights made it hard to see the audience, which was actually a relief. She sat down at the grand piano and placed her fingers on the cool, smooth keys.

For a moment, Emma's mind went blank. She couldn't remember how the song started. Panic rushed through her body. Then she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, just like her piano teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, had taught her. She thought about the music, not the audience.

Suddenly, her fingers knew what to do. They moved across the keys with grace and confidence. The melody flowed from the piano, filling the auditorium with beautiful sound. Emma forgot about being nervous. She was lost in the music, enjoying every note.

When she played the final chord, the room exploded with applause. Emma stood up and bowed, a huge smile spreading across her face. She had done it!
