Emma's hands trembled as she sat backstage, waiting for her turn to          12
perform. She had practiced her piano piece hundreds of times, but now, with   24
a room full of people waiting to hear her play, she felt her confidence       38
melting away like ice cream on a hot day.                                     47
    "Emma Chen," the announcer called. Her heart pounded as she walked        58
onto the stage. The bright lights made it hard to see the audience, which     72
was actually a relief. She sat down at the grand piano and placed her         86
fingers on the cool, smooth keys.                                             92
    For a moment, Emma's mind went blank. She couldn't remember how the      105
song started. Panic rushed through her body. Then she closed her eyes and    118
took a deep breath, just like her piano teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, had taught  131
her. She thought about the music, not the audience.                          140
    Suddenly, her fingers knew what to do. They moved across the keys with   154
grace and confidence. The melody flowed from the piano, filling the          165
auditorium with beautiful sound. Emma forgot about being nervous. She was    176
lost in the music, enjoying every note.                                      183
    When she played the final chord, the room exploded with applause.        194
Emma stood up and bowed, a huge smile spreading across her face. She had     208
done it!                                                                      210
