The moon is Earth's closest neighbor in space. It travels around our planet   13
as Earth travels around the sun. The moon does not make its own light. It     28
reflects light from the sun, which is why we can see it glowing in the night  45
sky.                                                                           46

The moon looks like it changes shape, but it really does not. We see          60
different amounts of the lit side of the moon as it moves around Earth.       74
These different shapes are called phases. When we see the whole lit side, we  88
call it a full moon. When we cannot see the lit side at all, we call it a    106
new moon.                                                                      108

The surface of the moon is covered with craters. Craters are big holes made  121
when rocks from space crash into the moon. The moon also has mountains and   135
flat areas called plains. There is no air or water on the moon, so nothing   150
can live there.                                                                153

The moon affects Earth in important ways. It pulls on Earth's oceans,        165
creating tides. High tide happens when the ocean water rises. Low tide       177
happens when the water goes back down.                                        184

In 1969, astronauts from the United States became the first people to walk   197
on the moon. They brought back moon rocks for scientists to study. Today, we 211
continue to learn more about our nearest neighbor in space.                   221
