Emma has a favorite stuffed rabbit named Fluffy. She takes Fluffy            10
everywhere. One day, Emma goes to the park with her family.                   20

Emma plays on the swings. She goes down the slide. She runs around the       34
playground. She has so much fun!                                              41

When it is time to go home, Emma looks for Fluffy. But Fluffy is not there!  57

"Mom! I cannot find Fluffy!" cries Emma. She feels very sad.                  68

Mom helps Emma look everywhere. They check the swings. They look by the      81
slide. They search near the trees. But they do not find Fluffy.              93

"Let's check the lost and found," says Mom.                                  101

They walk to the park office. A kind woman sits behind the desk.            114

"Did you lose something?" asks the woman.                                    121

"Yes, my rabbit," says Emma quietly.                                         127

The woman smiles and holds up Fluffy! "Is this your rabbit?" she asks.      140

"Fluffy!" shouts Emma happily. She hugs her rabbit tight.                    149

Emma is so glad to have Fluffy back!                                         157
