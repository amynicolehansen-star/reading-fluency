Ben's dad is washing the car. The car is very dirty.                          11

"Can I help?" asks Ben.                                                        15

"Yes!" says Dad. "You can help me."                                            22

Dad gives Ben a sponge. Ben dips the sponge in soapy water. He scrubs the     37
car door. Bubbles are everywhere!                                              42

Dad washes the top of the car. Ben washes the wheels. They work together.     56

"Good work, Ben!" says Dad.                                                    61

Next, Dad sprays the car with water. All the soap washes away. The car        75
looks shiny and clean.                                                         79

"We make a great team," says Dad.                                              86

Ben smiles. He is happy he could help. The car looks so nice now.             100

Dad and Ben put the bucket and sponges away. Then they go inside for a       115
snack.                                                                         116

"Thank you for helping me," says Dad.                                          123

"I like helping you," says Ben.                                                129
