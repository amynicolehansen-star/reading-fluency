Maya loved exploring her grandmother's backyard. One afternoon, while          10
chasing a butterfly, she noticed something unusual behind the old oak tree.   21
Hidden beneath twisted vines was a small wooden gate she had never seen       33
before.                                                                        34
    Her heart racing with excitement, Maya pushed aside the vines and         44
pulled on the rusty handle. The gate creaked open slowly, revealing a narrow  57
path covered with smooth stones. Colorful flowers lined both sides, and the   69
sweet smell of roses filled the air.                                          76
    "I wonder where this leads," Maya whispered to herself. She walked        87
carefully along the path, ducking under low branches. After a few minutes,    99
she arrived at a small clearing. In the center stood an old fountain with    113
water trickling from the top. Surrounding it were stone benches and more     125
beautiful flowers than she had ever seen in one place.                       135
    Maya sat on a bench and smiled. She had discovered her own secret        148
garden, a peaceful place where she could read, think, and dream. She         160
couldn't wait to visit again tomorrow.                                       166
