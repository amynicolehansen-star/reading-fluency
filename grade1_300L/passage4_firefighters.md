Firefighters are community helpers. They have an important job. They keep people safe from fires.

Firefighters wear special clothes to stay safe. They wear thick coats and pants. These protect them from heat and flames. They also wear heavy boots and helmets on their heads.

Firefighters ride in big red trucks called fire engines. The trucks carry water hoses, ladders, and other tools. When firefighters hear an alarm, they slide down a pole and jump on the truck. The truck races to the fire with its sirens on.

At the fire, firefighters work as a team. Some spray water on the flames. Others help people get out of burning buildings. Some firefighters use ladders to reach high places.

Firefighters also teach people about fire safety. They visit schools to show children how to stay safe. They tell us to have smoke alarms in our homes.

Firefighters are brave helpers. They risk their lives to save others!
