Carlos dribbled the basketball down the court, his sneakers squeaking         10
against the polished gym floor. The scoreboard showed only fifteen seconds    21
left in the championship game, and his team was losing by two points.         33
    "Pass it here!" his teammate Josh shouted from the corner. Carlos         44
glanced at Josh, who was wide open, but he also saw an opening near the       59
basket. For a split second, Carlos thought about taking the shot himself.     71
    Then he remembered what Coach Martinez always said: "Basketball is        81
a team sport. Trust your teammates." Carlos made his decision. He threw a     94
perfect bounce pass to Josh.                                                  99
    Josh caught the ball, aimed carefully, and released it toward the hoop.  112
The entire gym fell silent as the ball soared through the air. It hit the    128
backboard, bounced on the rim once, twice, and then dropped through the      140
net just as the buzzer sounded.                                              146
    The crowd erupted in cheers. Carlos's teammates rushed onto the court,   157
jumping and celebrating. Josh ran over and hugged Carlos. "That was an       169
amazing pass! We couldn't have won without you," he said, grinning from      181
ear to ear. Carlos smiled back, feeling proud that he had made the right     195
choice.                                                                       196
