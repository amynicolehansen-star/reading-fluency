Frogs are amphibians. This means they can live both in water and on land.     14
Frogs go through amazing changes as they grow. This is called metamorphosis.  26

A frog's life begins as a tiny egg in the water. Mother frogs lay many eggs  42
at once. The eggs stick together in a jelly-like substance. This keeps them   55
safe.                                                                          56

After about one week, a tadpole hatches from the egg. Tadpoles look very      69
different from adult frogs. They have long tails and no legs. They breathe    82
through gills, just like fish. Tadpoles eat algae and tiny plants in the      96
water.                                                                         97

As the tadpole grows, it begins to change. First, back legs start to grow.   111
Then front legs appear. The tail gets shorter and shorter. The tadpole also  124
grows lungs so it can breathe air.                                            131

Finally, the tadpole becomes a young frog. It hops out of the water and onto 146
land. Adult frogs eat insects like flies, mosquitoes, and beetles. They      157
catch bugs with their long, sticky tongues.                                   164

Frogs are important to nature. They eat many insects that can be pests. They 178
also provide food for other animals like birds and snakes.                    189
