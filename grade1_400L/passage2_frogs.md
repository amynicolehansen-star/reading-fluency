Frogs are amphibians. This means they can live both in water and on land. Frogs go through amazing changes as they grow. This is called metamorphosis.

A frog's life begins as a tiny egg in the water. Mother frogs lay many eggs at once. The eggs stick together in a jelly-like substance. This keeps them safe.

After about one week, a tadpole hatches from the egg. Tadpoles look very different from adult frogs. They have long tails and no legs. They breathe through gills, just like fish. Tadpoles eat algae and tiny plants in the water.

As the tadpole grows, it begins to change. First, back legs start to grow. Then front legs appear. The tail gets shorter and shorter. The tadpole also grows lungs so it can breathe air.

Finally, the tadpole becomes a young frog. It hops out of the water and onto land. Adult frogs eat insects like flies, mosquitoes, and beetles. They catch bugs with their long, sticky tongues.

Frogs are important to nature. They eat many insects that can be pests. They also provide food for other animals like birds and snakes.
