Bees are small insects. They have wings and can fly. Most bees are yellow and black.

Bees live together in a home called a hive. Many bees live in one hive. They work together as a team.

Bees make honey. They get nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid. Bees take the nectar back to the hive. They turn it into honey.

Bees help flowers grow. When a bee lands on a flower, pollen sticks to its body. The bee carries the pollen to other flowers. This helps new flowers grow.

Bees are very important. They help make food for us. Many fruits and vegetables need bees.

We should be kind to bees!
