Water moves around our planet in a cycle. This is called the water cycle.     14
The water cycle has three main steps.                                         21

First, the sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. The water turns  35
into tiny drops called water vapor. This is called evaporation. The water    47
vapor rises up into the sky.                                                  53

Next, the water vapor gets cold high in the sky. It turns back into water    68
drops. These drops form clouds. This step is called condensation.             78

Finally, the clouds get heavy with water. The water falls back to Earth as   92
rain, snow, or sleet. This is called precipitation. The water goes back into 105
oceans, lakes, and rivers.                                                    109

Then the cycle starts all over again! The water cycle never stops. It has    123
been happening for millions of years.                                         129

The water cycle is important. It brings fresh water to plants, animals, and  142
people all over the world.                                                    148
