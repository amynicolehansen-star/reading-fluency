The Arctic fox is one of nature's most impressive survivors. This small       12
animal lives in some of the coldest places on Earth, where temperatures can   25
drop to negative sixty degrees Fahrenheit. Despite these harsh conditions,    35
the Arctic fox has developed special features that help it thrive in its      48
frozen home.                                                                   50
    One of the fox's most useful adaptations is its thick, warm fur. In       63
winter, the Arctic fox grows a heavy white coat that provides excellent       75
insulation. This white color also serves as camouflage, helping the fox       86
blend in with the snow and ice. When summer arrives, the fox sheds its       100
white fur and grows a thinner brown or gray coat that matches the rocky,     113
barren landscape.                                                             115
    Another helpful feature is the fox's small, rounded ears. Unlike foxes   127
that live in warmer climates with large ears, the Arctic fox has short ears  141
that reduce heat loss. Even its feet are specially designed for the cold.    154
Thick fur covers the bottom of its paws, acting like natural snowshoes and   167
protecting against frozen ground.                                             171
    The Arctic fox is also an opportunistic eater, which means it will eat   184
almost anything it can find. During summer, it hunts small animals like      196
lemmings and birds. In winter, when food is scarce, the fox follows polar    209
bears and feeds on leftover scraps from their meals. This flexibility helps  221
the Arctic fox survive when other animals cannot.                            229
