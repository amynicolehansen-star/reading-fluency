Earth has four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasons change because Earth tilts as it travels around the sun. Different parts of Earth get more or less sunlight at different times of the year.

Spring is a time of new growth. The weather gets warmer after the cold winter. Flowers begin to bloom, and trees grow new leaves. Baby animals are born. Many birds return from their winter homes in warmer places. People plant gardens and enjoy the mild weather.

Summer is the warmest season. The days are long, and the sun is strong. Trees are full of green leaves. Many fruits and vegetables ripen in summer. Children have vacation from school. Families go to the beach, have picnics, and play outside.

Fall, also called autumn, comes after summer. The weather starts to get cooler. Leaves on many trees change color from green to red, orange, yellow, and brown. Then the leaves fall to the ground. Animals gather food to prepare for winter. Farmers harvest their crops.

Winter is the coldest season. The days are short, and the nights are long. In many places, snow falls and covers the ground. Some animals hibernate, which means they sleep through the winter. Other animals grow thick fur to stay warm. People wear heavy coats, hats, and gloves when they go outside.
