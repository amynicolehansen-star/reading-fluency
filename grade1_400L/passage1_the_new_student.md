Maria walks into her new classroom on the first day of school. She feels nervous because she does not know anyone here. All the other children are talking and laughing with their friends.

"Class, we have a new student today," says Mrs. Thompson, the teacher. "This is Maria. Let's make her feel welcome!"

The children smile and wave at Maria. She gives a small wave back.

At recess, Maria sits alone on a bench. She watches the other children play on the swings and climb on the monkey bars. She wishes she had a friend to play with.

A girl with red hair comes over to Maria. "Hi! My name is Sophie," she says with a friendly smile. "Do you want to play with me and my friends?"

Maria's face lights up. "Yes! I would love to!" she says happily.

Sophie takes Maria's hand. They run to the playground together. Sophie introduces Maria to all her friends. They play tag and go down the slide.

When recess ends, Maria feels much better. She made new friends! School is not so scary anymore. Maria cannot wait to come back tomorrow.
