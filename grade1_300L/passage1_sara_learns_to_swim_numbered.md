Sara stands at the edge of the pool. She feels nervous. The water looks deep  16
and cold.                                                                      18

"Come on, Sara!" calls her swim teacher, Miss Kelly. "You can do it!"         30

Sara remembers what Miss Kelly taught her. She takes a deep breath. Then she  44
jumps into the water with a big splash!                                       52

The water feels cool on her skin. Sara kicks her legs like Miss Kelly showed  67
her. She moves her arms back and forth. Sara is swimming!                     78

"Great job!" says Miss Kelly with a smile. "Keep going!"                      88

Sara swims all the way across the pool. When she gets to the other side, she 104
holds onto the wall. She feels so proud of herself.                           115

"I did it!" Sara shouts happily.                                              121

Her mom and dad clap from the side of the pool. They are so proud of Sara    138
too.                                                                           139

Sara cannot wait to come back next week. Swimming is fun!                     150
