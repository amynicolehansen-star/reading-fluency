##### PASSAGE 1: FICTION - The Secret Garden Path

```
Maya loved exploring her grandmother's backyard. One afternoon, while          10
chasing a butterfly, she noticed something unusual behind the old oak tree.   21
Hidden beneath twisted vines was a small wooden gate she had never seen       33
before.                                                                        34
    Her heart racing with excitement, Maya pushed aside the vines and         44
pulled on the rusty handle. The gate creaked open slowly, revealing a narrow  57
path covered with smooth stones. Colorful flowers lined both sides, and the   69
sweet smell of roses filled the air.                                          76
    "I wonder where this leads," Maya whispered to herself. She walked        87
carefully along the path, ducking under low branches. After a few minutes,    99
she arrived at a small clearing. In the center stood an old fountain with    113
water trickling from the top. Surrounding it were stone benches and more     125
beautiful flowers than she had ever seen in one place.                       135
    Maya sat on a bench and smiled. She had discovered her own secret        148
garden, a peaceful place where she could read, think, and dream. She         160
couldn't wait to visit again tomorrow.                                       166
```

##### PASSAGE 2: NONFICTION - How Butterflies Grow

```
Butterflies go through an amazing transformation during their lives. This     10
process is called metamorphosis, and it has four distinct stages that can     22
take anywhere from a few weeks to several months.                             31
    The first stage begins when a female butterfly lays tiny eggs on a leaf.  46
She carefully chooses plants that will provide food for her babies. Each      58
egg is smaller than a pinhead, but it contains everything needed to start a   72
new life.                                                                      74
    In the second stage, a caterpillar hatches from the egg. The              85
caterpillar's main job is to eat. It munches on leaves constantly, growing    97
bigger and bigger. As it grows, the caterpillar sheds its skin several times 110
because the old skin becomes too tight.                                      117
    The third stage is perhaps the most mysterious. The caterpillar forms a  130
hard shell called a chrysalis around its body. Inside this protective        142
covering, the caterpillar's body completely reorganizes itself. Wings, legs, 151
and antennae develop during this resting period.                             158
    Finally, in the fourth stage, an adult butterfly emerges from the        170
chrysalis. At first, its wings are wet and crumpled. The butterfly must pump 183
fluid into its wings and wait for them to dry before it can fly away and     199
begin the cycle again.                                                       203
```

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. What are the four stages of a butterfly's life cycle?

2. Why does a caterpillar shed its skin several times?

3. What happens inside the chrysalis during the third stage?

4. Why can't a butterfly fly immediately after emerging from the chrysalis?

##### PASSAGE 3: FICTION - The Winning Shot

```
Carlos dribbled the basketball down the court, his sneakers squeaking         10
against the polished gym floor. The scoreboard showed only fifteen seconds    21
left in the championship game, and his team was losing by two points.         33
    "Pass it here!" his teammate Josh shouted from the corner. Carlos         44
glanced at Josh, who was wide open, but he also saw an opening near the       59
basket. For a split second, Carlos thought about taking the shot himself.     71
    Then he remembered what Coach Martinez always said: "Basketball is        81
a team sport. Trust your teammates." Carlos made his decision. He threw a     94
perfect bounce pass to Josh.                                                  99
    Josh caught the ball, aimed carefully, and released it toward the hoop.  112
The entire gym fell silent as the ball soared through the air. It hit the    128
backboard, bounced on the rim once, twice, and then dropped through the      140
net just as the buzzer sounded.                                              146
    The crowd erupted in cheers. Carlos's teammates rushed onto the court,   157
jumping and celebrating. Josh ran over and hugged Carlos. "That was an       169
amazing pass! We couldn't have won without you," he said, grinning from      181
ear to ear. Carlos smiled back, feeling proud that he had made the right     195
choice.                                                                       196
```

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. What difficult decision did Carlos have to make during the game?

2. What advice from Coach Martinez helped Carlos make his decision?

3. Describe what happened after Josh released the ball toward the hoop.

4. How do you think Carlos felt at the end of the story? Explain your reasoning.

##### PASSAGE 4: NONFICTION - The Amazing Arctic Fox

```
The Arctic fox is one of nature's most impressive survivors. This small       12
animal lives in some of the coldest places on Earth, where temperatures can   25
drop to negative sixty degrees Fahrenheit. Despite these harsh conditions,    35
the Arctic fox has developed special features that help it thrive in its      48
frozen home.                                                                   50
    One of the fox's most useful adaptations is its thick, warm fur. In       63
winter, the Arctic fox grows a heavy white coat that provides excellent       75
insulation. This white color also serves as camouflage, helping the fox       86
blend in with the snow and ice. When summer arrives, the fox sheds its       100
white fur and grows a thinner brown or gray coat that matches the rocky,     113
barren landscape.                                                             115
    Another helpful feature is the fox's small, rounded ears. Unlike foxes   127
that live in warmer climates with large ears, the Arctic fox has short ears  141
that reduce heat loss. Even its feet are specially designed for the cold.    154
Thick fur covers the bottom of its paws, acting like natural snowshoes and   167
protecting against frozen ground.                                             171
    The Arctic fox is also an opportunistic eater, which means it will eat   184
almost anything it can find. During summer, it hunts small animals like      196
lemmings and birds. In winter, when food is scarce, the fox follows polar    209
bears and feeds on leftover scraps from their meals. This flexibility helps  221
the Arctic fox survive when other animals cannot.                            229
```

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. Name two physical adaptations that help the Arctic fox survive in cold temperatures.

2. How does the Arctic fox's fur change between winter and summer, and why?

3. What does it mean that the Arctic fox is an "opportunistic eater"?

4. How does the Arctic fox find food during the winter months?

##### PASSAGE 5: FICTION - The Piano Recital

```
Emma's hands trembled as she sat backstage, waiting for her turn to          12
perform. She had practiced her piano piece hundreds of times, but now, with   24
a room full of people waiting to hear her play, she felt her confidence       38
melting away like ice cream on a hot day.                                     47
    "Emma Chen," the announcer called. Her heart pounded as she walked        58
onto the stage. The bright lights made it hard to see the audience, which     72
was actually a relief. She sat down at the grand piano and placed her         86
fingers on the cool, smooth keys.                                             92
    For a moment, Emma's mind went blank. She couldn't remember how the      105
song started. Panic rushed through her body. Then she closed her eyes and    118
took a deep breath, just like her piano teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, had taught  131
her. She thought about the music, not the audience.                          140
    Suddenly, her fingers knew what to do. They moved across the keys with   154
grace and confidence. The melody flowed from the piano, filling the          165
auditorium with beautiful sound. Emma forgot about being nervous. She was    176
lost in the music, enjoying every note.                                      183
    When she played the final chord, the room exploded with applause.        194
Emma stood up and bowed, a huge smile spreading across her face. She had     208
done it!                                                                      210
```

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. How did Emma feel before her performance? Use details from the text.

2. What technique did Mrs. Rodriguez teach Emma that helped her during the recital?

3. What does the author mean when she writes that Emma's confidence was "melting away like ice cream on a hot day"?

##### PASSAGE 6: NONFICTION - Ancient Egyptian Pyramids

```
The pyramids of ancient Egypt are among the most recognizable structures      11
in the world. Built thousands of years ago, these massive stone monuments     23
continue to amaze people today. The largest and most famous is the Great      36
Pyramid of Giza, which was constructed around 2560 BCE as a tomb for          49
Pharaoh Khufu.                                                                 51
    Building the pyramids required incredible planning and effort. Workers    60
had to cut enormous limestone blocks from quarries, with each block           71
weighing about two and a half tons—as much as a large elephant. Then they     86
transported these heavy stones to the building site, sometimes from miles     97
away. Historians believe that workers used wooden sleds and rollers to move  109
the blocks, and may have wet the sand in front of the sleds to reduce       124
friction.                                                                     125
    Once the stones arrived at the pyramid site, workers faced another       136
challenge: lifting them into place. The Great Pyramid stands 481 feet tall   148
and contains approximately 2.3 million stone blocks. Researchers think the   158
ancient Egyptians built long ramps that spiraled around the pyramid,         168
allowing workers to drag the blocks up to higher levels as the structure     181
grew.                                                                         182
    The pyramids weren't just impressive feats of construction. They also    192
demonstrate the ancient Egyptians' advanced understanding of mathematics     200
and astronomy. The sides of the Great Pyramid are almost perfectly aligned   212
with the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. This level  225
of precision, achieved without modern tools, shows the remarkable skills of  236
these ancient builders.                                                       239
```

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS:**

1. What was the main purpose of the pyramids?

2. Describe two challenges that workers faced when building the pyramids.

3. How did ancient Egyptian builders demonstrate their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy?

4. According to the passage, approximately how many stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid?
