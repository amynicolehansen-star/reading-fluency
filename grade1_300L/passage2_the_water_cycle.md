Water moves around our planet in a cycle. This is called the water cycle. The water cycle has three main steps.

First, the sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. The water turns into tiny drops called water vapor. This is called evaporation. The water vapor rises up into the sky.

Next, the water vapor gets cold high in the sky. It turns back into water drops. These drops form clouds. This step is called condensation.

Finally, the clouds get heavy with water. The water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or sleet. This is called precipitation. The water goes back into oceans, lakes, and rivers.

Then the cycle starts all over again! The water cycle never stops. It has been happening for millions of years.

The water cycle is important. It brings fresh water to plants, animals, and people all over the world.
