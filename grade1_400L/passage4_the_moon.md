The moon is Earth's closest neighbor in space. It travels around our planet as Earth travels around the sun. The moon does not make its own light. It reflects light from the sun, which is why we can see it glowing in the night sky.

The moon looks like it changes shape, but it really does not. We see different amounts of the lit side of the moon as it moves around Earth. These different shapes are called phases. When we see the whole lit side, we call it a full moon. When we cannot see the lit side at all, we call it a new moon.

The surface of the moon is covered with craters. Craters are big holes made when rocks from space crash into the moon. The moon also has mountains and flat areas called plains. There is no air or water on the moon, so nothing can live there.

The moon affects Earth in important ways. It pulls on Earth's oceans, creating tides. High tide happens when the ocean water rises. Low tide happens when the water goes back down.

In 1969, astronauts from the United States became the first people to walk on the moon. They brought back moon rocks for scientists to study. Today, we continue to learn more about our nearest neighbor in space.
