Tommy and his dad pack the car for their camping trip. They bring a tent,     15
sleeping bags, food, and fishing poles. Tommy is very excited because this is 28
his first time camping.                                                        32

They drive to the mountains and find a perfect spot next to a lake. Dad shows 48
Tommy how to set up the tent. Together, they hammer the stakes into the       62
ground and pull the tent tight.                                                68

"Good teamwork!" says Dad with a smile.                                        75

After the tent is ready, they go fishing at the lake. Tommy holds his fishing 90
pole very still. Suddenly, he feels a tug!                                     98

"Dad! I got one!" shouts Tommy.                                                104

Dad helps Tommy reel in the fish. It is a beautiful trout with shiny scales.  119
They take a picture with the fish before putting it back in the water.        133

That evening, they cook hot dogs over the campfire. Tommy roasts              144
marshmallows for dessert. The marshmallows turn golden brown and taste        154
delicious.                                                                     155

When the sky gets dark, Dad and Tommy lie on a blanket and look up at the     172
stars. Tommy has never seen so many stars before! They look for               184
constellations in the night sky.                                               190

"This is the best day ever," says Tommy sleepily.                              199

"I'm glad you're having fun," says Dad, giving Tommy a hug.                    211
