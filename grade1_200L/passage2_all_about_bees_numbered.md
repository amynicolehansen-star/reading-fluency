Bees are small insects. They have wings and can fly. Most bees are yellow     14
and black.                                                                     16

Bees live together in a home called a hive. Many bees live in one hive. They  32
work together as a team.                                                       37

Bees make honey. They get nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid.      50
Bees take the nectar back to the hive. They turn it into honey.               64

Bees help flowers grow. When a bee lands on a flower, pollen sticks to its    79
body. The bee carries the pollen to other flowers. This helps new flowers     92
grow.                                                                          93

Bees are very important. They help make food for us. Many fruits and         106
vegetables need bees.                                                         109

We should be kind to bees!                                                    115
