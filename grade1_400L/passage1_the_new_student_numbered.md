```
Maria walks into her new classroom on the first day of school. She feels      15
nervous because she does not know anyone here. All the other children are     28
talking and laughing with their friends.                                       34

"Class, we have a new student today," says Mrs. Thompson, the teacher. "This  47
is Maria. Let's make her feel welcome!"                                        55

The children smile and wave at Maria. She gives a small wave back.            68

At recess, Maria sits alone on a bench. She watches the other children play  82
on the swings and climb on the monkey bars. She wishes she had a friend to    99
play with.                                                                     101

A girl with red hair comes over to Maria. "Hi! My name is Sophie," she says  117
with a friendly smile. "Do you want to play with me and my friends?"          131

Maria's face lights up. "Yes! I would love to!" she says happily.             144

Sophie takes Maria's hand. They run to the playground together. Sophie        155
introduces Maria to all her friends. They play tag and go down the slide.     170

When recess ends, Maria feels much better. She made new friends! School is    183
not so scary anymore. Maria cannot wait to come back tomorrow.                194
